## Queue-simulator

###Queue simulator using pseudorandom generated numbers.

The queue simulator is a precise simulator with constant switching seeds that generates pseudorandom queues simulations, it's characteristics are:

- Can generate N_Clients for a queue
- Can generate N_Queues for a system (An example would be a supermarket)
- Can calculate metrics like average time spent in queue, average cashier free time and other metrics.
- True randomness is garanted due to constant switching seeds and generating new seeds.
- The number of systems of queues tested is exactly 500 due to processing long times, but it can be set as high as the user wants.
- The higher the number of systems teste the precise are the predictions in this pseudorandom model
